### Dependency:
* python >= 3.7
* mutagen
* PyQt6 (python and Qt6 bindings)

### Run:
* Navigate to source dir in console and type: `python xting.py` in console to run the application
* or directly click `xting.py` to run
* another way would be to install the executable from the releases tag

### Authors:
* sanfanling (xujia19@outlook.com) (the original author)
* putridambassador121 (the maintainer of this fork)

### Note:
* Originally developed in the Linux environment by the original author, now it runs on Windows 10 and is being developed by me there.

### Next todo list:
* [x] make it search for cover art on the file itself, all 4 file extensions are supported: ".mp3", ".flac", ".m4a" and ".ogg". (more file extension support are planned)
* [] make it search for cover art online if the cover is not available on the file
* [x] add a sound driver watcher on the gui (make it detect automatically if a sound device like a headphone got disconnected, without needing to restart the app just to use it)
